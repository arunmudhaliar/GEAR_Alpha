# Helper makefile to simplity the call to make -f Makefile
# This Makefile automatically sets the target to be compiled: static
# define M64 = -m64 for 64 bit compilation or, alternatively, set
# M64 with the same value as a shell environment variable and call: make -e
#
# usage: make -f Makefile-static [[-e M64=-m64 ] [-e VARIANT=debug]]

SHELL       = /bin/sh

# called when a specific rule is defined on the command line
